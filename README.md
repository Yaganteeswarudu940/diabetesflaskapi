# diabetesflaskapi
Diabetes Risk prediction and flask API implementation
This is a project which will perform all classification algorithms , and neural netwrk implementation by using tensorflow 
Risk prediction by using logistic regression
Flask API is implemented
Templates are designed 
through the front values will be sent to model and model will predict the diabtes or not and also risk factor
based on risk factor patient will be given suggestion


Diabetes analysis in many existing systems considered few parameters like age, sex, bmi, insulin, glucose, blood pressure, diabetes pedigree function, pregnancies. But in this paper we considered in addition to age, sex, bmi, insulin, glucose, blood pressure, diabetes pedigree function, pregnancies we  included serum creatinine, potassium, GlasgowComaScale, heart rate/pulse Rate,respiration rate,body temparature,low density lipoprotein(LDL),high density lipoprotein (HDL),TG (Triglycerides). Our paper includes analysis of Pima Indian diabetes datasets which is available in UCI machine learning repository, the data set which was acquired from a hospital in Frankfurt, Germany and also visited some local hospitals to get Data sets for diabetes analysis. Due to analysis includes all parameters which causes diabetes, which may be helpful in detecting diseases like heart disease, neuropath, retinopathy, hearing loss, and dementia. This paper main aim is to analyse the datasets by using different machine learning algorithms along with parameter tuning.  One more important feature of this article is to analyse diabetes risk factor and based on risk factor providing suggestions to the patients.
